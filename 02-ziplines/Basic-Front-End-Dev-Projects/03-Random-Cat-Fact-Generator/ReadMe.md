 ```
  Praticed using external static APIs (I found the cat facts API on my own- it as not given to me and getting it to work took me some time, cross origin request)
  How to use Twitter's API to create tweet button and Tweet facts with hastags and credit 
  How to minizme URLS (tiny URL to save tweet space)

```
