What I learned from this project:
  Praticed creating Varibles in HTML code rather than static characters (time and rest peroids)
  Praticed creating shapes in CSS
  Adding functions to buttons (add and subtract- and not letting time go below zero)

Future Features/To Do:

  Add CSS to dispaly time passing by
