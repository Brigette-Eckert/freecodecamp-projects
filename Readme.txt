Excersies and Projects I completed at Freecode camp. 

Bonfires are coding challenges where I was given a problem and then had to code the solution.  

Ziplines are front web development projects where I was given a site or application to reverse enginner. 

Base Jumps are full stack web development projects where I was given a site or application to reverse enginner.
